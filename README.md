### openCV_timeLapse

## Introduction : 
this project includes creating a timelapse video from live video which has recorded through web cam,
using openCV and python

## Brief :
generally timeLapse photography is a technique whereby the frequency at which film frames are 
captured (the frame rate) is much more spread out than the frequency used to view the sequence { source : [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-lapse_photography) }.
So, using openCV, we used the video from webcam, and read it frame-by-frame and and *extracting frames* at 
stated *smaller time-periods* and *storing them* in form of images, which to be used again to form a smaller final timeLapse video using OpenCV.
